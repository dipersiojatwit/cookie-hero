# cookie-hero
This repository is for the development of a game I've been making in Unity called Cookie Hero. 
# About the game
Cookie Hero is a simple high score based arcade style game. Playing as Cookie Hero, a cookie-craving fine young man, you'll collect as many cookies as you can 
as they fall from the sky. But watch out! The vile, trash-loving, cookie-hating Stinkus will throw trash at Cookie Hero just to ruin his day!  
# How to play
I plan on having Cookie Hero available to play online, but the game's 0.1 build can be played now by running Cookie Hero 0.1.exe in the CookieHeroBuild0.1 folder. Although this is an early build, I've tried to polish it with subtle touches and Easter eggs.  
# Future Builds
I plan to add new mechanics, like bonus rounds, and more fun characters. I'm also working on upgrading the game's visuals too!
