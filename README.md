# cookie-hero
This repository is for the development of a game I've been making in Unity called Cookie Hero. 
# About the game
Cookie Hero is a simple high score based arcade style game. Playing as Cookie Hero, a cookie-craving fine young man, you'll collect as many Cookies as you can 
as they fall from the sky while avoiding falling trash thrown by the vile Stinkus.
# Future Development
Going foward, I plan to add many more mechanics like bonus rounds, new hazards, and more odd characters.
