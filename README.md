# cookie-hero
This repository is for the development of a game I've been making in Unity called Cookie Hero. 
# About the game
Cookie Hero is a simple high score based arcade style game. Playing as Cookie Hero, a cookie-craving fine young man, you'll collect as many Cookies as you can 
as they fall from the sky while avoiding falling trash thrown by the vile Stinkus.
# How to play
In the future, Cookie Hero will be available to play online, but the game's 0.1 build can be played now by running Cookie Hero 0.1.exe in the CookieHeroBuild0.1 folder.
